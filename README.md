This code:

Preprocesses and normalizes the Breast Cancer malignance data, and deletes uninformative columns.

Next, it applies K-means clustering and PCA to look for potential new features.

Finally, it compares and optimizes different classification models to find the best one for classification of breast tumors as M (Malignant) or B (Benign).

Best accuracy at 97.37% (With Cross-Validation to avoid overfitting).
